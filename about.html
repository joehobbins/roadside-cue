      <p>My passion for preparing great food started when I was young. As the middle child of four boys, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen helping my mom cook enough food to keep up with four growing boys. This is where I began learning about flavor profiles and the unique combinations that make great food exceptional. My dad also played a solid role in my love for grilling. He would get out the old, red charcoal Weber Grill and spend some of the weekend cooking steaks, pork loins, and even crab legs on the Weber. Preparing great food and sharing it with my family and friends is part of my everyday life.</p>

      <p>My wife, Heather, and I — along with our two children — moved from Denver, Colorado back to Heather’s hometown of Rainsville in July of 2015, Roadside ‘Que became a reality in October 2015.</p>
